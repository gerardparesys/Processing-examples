[Processing](https://processing.org/) sketch to test ["AudioSample"](http://code.compartmental.net/minim/audiosample_class_audiosample.html) of the [Minim](http://code.compartmental.net/minim/) library   
"An AudioSample keeps the entire file in an internal buffer and all you can do is trigger() the sound.  
We now recommend using Sampler class from the ugens package because it is more full-featured than AudioSample."
